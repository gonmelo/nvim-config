# Neovim Config üë®‚Äçüíª
This repo has my neovim config, including different plugins, my keymaps, and general customizations for coding.
The config is based inspired on:
- [neovim-for-newbs](https://github.com/cpow/neovim-for-newbs),
- Typecraft's awesome series: [Neovim for Newbs. FREE NEOVIM COURSE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn)
- And last but not least: [Primeagen's video: 0 to LSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=604s)
Make sure to check them out and feel free to reach out with any questions!

**Note**: The present config mainly supports Python code since that's most of my work. However, it should be easy enough to extend to other languages following the same patterns.

# Requirements
- A C compiler in your path and libstdc++ installed. ([For tree-sitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)).
- tar and curl in your path (or git).
- A lot of faith that this will work out of the box üôè
